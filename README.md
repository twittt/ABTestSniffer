## A Little More About my Thought Process

I spent a good about of time trying to understand what is happening under the hood here. I woudl say the majority of the tiem I spent on this project was to unserstand how these kinds of A/B tests are implemented and what it means to listed for the response of those scripting calls. 

Ultimately, I ran out of time and wan't able to fully wrangle the regex to produce valid JSON but it's close and when pasted into a validator that formats it (I like this one: https://jsonchecker.com/), I think it provides helpful insight into what's going on. I also tried to build a web interfact but the delay was causing chaos. If you don't see this until next week I might very well have built it by then. 

## Roadmap
- I would love to see this actually structure the data since there really is so much there
- Building a web interface (I wrote the one below but couldn't get it to work ultimately) tso we can just enter a list of URLs would be cool
